        <h3>Hi, I'm Taylor Misch. This site has been a bit of a passion project of mine for a long time now. As a software developer, I've always thought it is a rite of passage to create your own website - so here's mine.</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>On this site I post projects that I've worked on (inside and outside the realm of software development), things I'm interested in, and pictures from my latest adventure - whatever that may be. Feel free to look around or reach out to me if you think I can help you in anyway or would just like to talk about something you see here.</h3>
